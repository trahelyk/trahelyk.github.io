Hi. This is a landing page for trahelyk.com, which is my personal domain. My name is Kyle Hart, and I'm a biostatistician in OB/GYN at [Oregon Health & Science University](http://www.ohsu.edu). I also am available for moonlighting. For more about me and what I've done, take a look at my CV.

Do you have questions?
**Q: What means "trahelyk?"**

A: Nothing. It's just my name backwards.

**Q: What have you put on Github?**

A: I'm working on a suite of convenience functions that I use to ease my day-to-day workflow. Things that might interest other people include these projects:

* My tidy_tableone() function, which summarizes a dataset and produces a Markdown, HTML, or LaTeX table with a single function call.  
* My present_mdl() function, which formats and presents a Markdown, HTML, or \LaTeX summary for a variety of different kinds of regression models. 

Both of these can be found in my package [trahelyk](https://github.com/trahelyk/trahelyk_pkg), which is very much a work in progress. I tinker with it here and there as I'm using it, so development is steady by slow. I'm trying to adapt it to the tidyverse mindset and to make it use tidyverse tools and principles wherever possible.
