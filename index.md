Q: What means "trahelyk?" 
A: Nothing. It's just my name backwards.

Q: What have you put on Github?
A: I'm working on a suite of convenience functions that I use to ease my day-to-day workflow. Things that might interest other people include these projects:
* My tidy_tableone() function, which summarizes a dataset and produces a Markdown, HTML, or LaTeX table with a single function call.  
* My present_mdl() function, which formats and presents a Markdown, HTML, or LaTeX summary for a variety of different kinds of regression models. 
Both of these projects are very much works in progress. I tinker with them here and there as I'm using them, so development is steady by slow. I'm trying to adapt them to the tidyverse mindset and to make them use tidyverse tools and principles wherever possible.
